# Functions

## Homework Due Wednesday, March 13 at noon.

For this assignment, you should create a javascript function that is a simple 
calculator. The function should take three arguments (i.e., inputs):

* num1 - a number
* num2 - another number
* operator - +,-,*,/ (the math operation to be performed)

Save your code to a file in your home directory called *homework.js*

Make sure to test your function by running it in the Node REPL. Full credit 
will be given only for code that works correctly.

Good luck!
