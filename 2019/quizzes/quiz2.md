# Quiz 2

## 90 minutes

## Part 1 - 10 points

Please login to our server. Find your quizzes directory. In that directory, 
create a new file called quiz2.js

In this file, please do the following:

1. Define a variable that is a string.
2. Define two variables, both of which are numbers.
3. Create a function that accepts both of your number variables as arguments 
   and returns those two variables added together. Execute the function and
   ensure that it is adding your numbers correctly.

You can execute your function by closing your file and typing in nodejs at the 
prompt. Once nodejs is open, type the following:

```js

.load quiz2.js

```

This should run your file and you should see the result of your function in the 
last line.

## Part 2 - 10 points

This part determines your ability to create a HTML page with functioning 
javascript. The goal is simply to submit a request to the server and to display 
the response. For this part, please do the following:

1. Go to your public_html directory. Create a file called quiz2.html and 
   another called quiz2.js (note, this is different from the one you just 
   created in your quizzes directory).
2. In your HTML file, create a valid webpage (head, body, etc) which includes 
   your quiz2.js file and jQuery. Add a button to your page that says "Get 
   Message."  Lastly, add a paragraph tag with the ID of "results".  
3. In your quiz2.js file, write some jQuery that submits an AJAX request via a 
   GET request to the following URL:  https://loyolalawtech.org/json/quiz.php.  
   (Note that there is no data sent with this request)
4. Display the response from the server in your "results" paragraph.

You may use your class notes and your homeworks to help you with this. You may 
not, however, collaborate with your classmates in any way. Good luck!
