# jQuery - Some New Methods

To practice a bit more, please do the following in jQuery: 


* Create an unordered list (html tag: ul). Create an anchor tag that when 
clicked adds items to the unordered list. Use jQuery's *append* method.

* Create another anchor tag that, when clicked, removes the last list item. Use 
jQuery's *last()* and *remove()* methods

* Create a form with one text input called "username". Using jQuery, check that 
the user has not submitted and empty form field and give them a warning that 
username is required if they do. Use jQuery's *val()* method to get the user's 
input.

* Now change your form. Pretend your user is submitting a new username. You 
have a rule that all usernames must be at least 5 characters long. Give the 
user a warning if they submit a username less than 5 characters. To check if 
the user has supplied enough characters, use javascript's built in *length* 
method.
