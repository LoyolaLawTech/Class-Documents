# Homework 3 - Functions

For this assignment, you are to create two functions in JSBin. Both functions should output to the console using console.log().

1. Define a function called max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use an if/else statement 
in your function. 

2. Create a function that is a calculator. Your function should take three arguments - operator (plus, minus, multiply, divide), 
number 1, and number 2. The function should take the two numbers, perform the appropriate mathematical operation, and then output 
the answer to the console. Hint: Your function should probably have four "if" statements. You may want to refer to our
