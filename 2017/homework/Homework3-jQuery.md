# Homework 3 - jQuery

Open a new JSBin and add the jQuery 3.1.0 library to your HTML, like we did in 
class. Next, add the following HTML:

```html
 <p class="important">Paragraph One<p>
    <p class="important">Paragraph Two<p>
    <p id="notImportant">Paragraph Three<p>
    
    <button id="highlight">Highlight Important</button>
    <button id="changeText">Change Text</button>
<script>
```

Now, in the Javascript pane, write the code to make jQuery do the following:

1. Change the background color of all text in the paragraphs with the class 
   "important" to yellow.
2. Change the text of the paragraph with the ID of "notImportant"  to "This is 
   not important".

Here is a [short 
screencast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7JWfzOhqNgNVURwYWVRU1E5Q1k/view) 
to show you how your code should work.

This homework is due to me by Wednesday, March 8 at noon.
