# Homework 1 - HTML

Today in class we created our first HTML documents. For your homework, I would 
like you to create a new HTML document about legal software. Do some research 
on the internet about software available for lawyers and for law-usage in 
general.  You can pick any kind of software, a web site, a mobile app, 
whatever, just make sure it's law-related.

Next, using JSBin, create an HTML document that describes the software and the 
features it has. Please include at least one screenshot of the software (using 
an img tag)  in your document. Please further provide at least two paragraphs 
of description of the software or other information related to the software. 
Also include a bulleted list of the features the software offers.

In addition to standard head and body tags, this assignment will require you to 
use, at least, the following tags: p, img, h1, h2, ul, li. Be prepared to show 
your page in class and to tell other students briefly about your chosen 
software.

Please email me the URL of your completed JSBin on or before 5pm Tuesday, 
January 24.
