# Final Assignement

Please create a simple app that looks and functions more or less like the one in 
[this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7JWfzOhqNgNZ3BIbjZiWmhad2s/view).

You can use the [code that we created today in class](http://jsbin.com/veyudoc/edit?html,js) and 
our [recent ajax assignment](http://jsbin.com/zirodah/edit?html,js,output) as guides. The data
source for this assignment is at http://107.170.75.124/courts/courts.json

You will get full credit if you create a page that makes two ajax repquests, one to populate
the options in the select element and another to return the court house information.

This assignment is due by 5pm on April 19.
