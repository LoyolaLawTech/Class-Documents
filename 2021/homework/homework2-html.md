# Homework 2 - HTML

## Due Wednesday, January 27 at 5pm

Please create a file called homework2.html in your public_html directory. In 
that file, create a page of html which lists three things. It can be anything, 
your favorite food, a to-do list, whatever you want, as long as it is a list of 
three things. Your page should include a title (expressed in an H1 tag) saying 
what the list is and then an unordered list (a UL tag enclosing three LI tags) 
with your list items. Extra credit will be given if you include a relevant 
image in the page and a link to some other relevant page or pages. 

All tags must be properly closed. Don't forget that you need a HEAD tag and 
that your content must be within a BODY tag. Here's a little something to get 
you started:

```html
<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>


    </body>
</html>
```
