# Homework 6 Jquery

## Due March 10 at 5pm.

For this assignment, create two files and put them in your public_html 
directory:

jqueryhm.html
jqueryhm.js

Load jQuery in your HTML file and create two inputs, one for "First Name" and
another for "Last Name", and a button. In your jqueryhm.js file, write some 
jQuery which checks that the data the user put in the form fields is valid.  

There should be two validation rules:

* Neither field can be blank
* The names put in each field must be longer than one letter.

If these rules are not met, display an alert to the user telling them what is 
wrong. Similarly, if the rules are met, tell the user their data is valid.

Extra Credit: In addition to the alert, write the error message to an element 
in your page. [Here is an example 
video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2_HlKu5TgkuLiM6kF2SKFFYOU-fYMY6/view)  
which contains the inputs, the validation, and then displays the error (note 
you cannot see the alert in the video).
