# Homework 1

## Due January 21 at noon.

We start with a very simple homework. Don't get used to it! Please do the following steps:

1. Log on to your account on dev.loyolalawtech.org
2. Navigate to your home directory
3. Create a new directory within your home (/home/yourusername) directory entitled homework
4. Switch into the homework directory and create a new file called my_schedule
5. Write a document in vim which contains your class schedule for this 
   semester. It can be in any format you like, just as long as it is readable.
6. Save the file and exit the server.
