# Optional Homework on Grids

For this optional, ungraded assignment, create an HTML file in your public_html
folder called grids2.html. Use skeleton.css to create a grid with the following
characteristics:

* Two Rows
* The first row contains two columns each of which take up half of the row 
(i.e, 6 columns)
* The second row contains three equal columns.
* Each box created by the grid should have an H1 in it which identifies the 
box, i.e, "Box 1", "Box 2", all the way to Box 5.

Because this is ungraded, feel free to contact me with questions.
