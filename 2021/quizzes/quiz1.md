# Quiz 1 - HTML

## 30 points

For this quiz, you will be asked to create a simple timekeeping app. The app 
will have a form that records work the user has done. The fields will capture
the date, hours, minutes, and a description of the work done. The form should 
submit a post request to https://loyolalawtech.org/quiz/time.php. That script 
expects that your form fields have the following names: date, hours, minutes, 
and description. Further, your page will have two equal sized columns using the 
Skeleton grid. The left column will tell the user what the app is for. The 
right column will contain the form.

Please take a look at [this screencast](quiz.mp4) to get an idea of what this 
app should look like.

In order to get full credit, your app must: 

* Have a valid HTML file called quiz.html in your public_html folder
* Load skeleton.css
* Have a correctly formed grid with two equal columns
* Correctly use the "date" and "number" inputs
* Contain all the fields described above, properly labeled
* Successfully submit the data to the server

You have 90 minutes to complete this. Do your best and know that partial credit 
will be given. You may use internet resources and your own notes to complete 
this task, but you may not communicate with any one other than your professor 
and you may not look at your classmate's work.

Good luck!
