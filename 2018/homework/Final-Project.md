# Final Project
## Due on or before May 7 at 6pm

For our final project, you will be asked to create an app which pulls together 
all of the things we have learned this semester. You may choose to do an app 
from any one of these three groups:

1. Create a client eligibility screener or calculator for a particular legal 
   claim or benefit. This will be similar to the algorithm-based apps that we 
   did earlier in the semester, but it should be from a different area of law.  
   Additionally, this app should have a new feature of your choice, such as a 
   page that refers the user to additional legal resources related to the 
   user's claim.

2. Create an app that queries against a law-related API and returns results to 
   the user. Here is a [list of some law 
   APIs](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/law/apis?category=20269) that 
   may be useful for this. 

3. An law-related app idea of your own making. Please see me to get approval 
   and suggestions before starting.

Your app should at a minimum use HTML, CSS ([Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) 
or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS preferred, but you may create your 
own), and Javascript/jQuery.  Your app should clearly state in the HTML what it 
does, who it is for, and how to use it. Bonus points will be given to those 
apps which show the most originality and effort.  This assignment is worth 
30 points.

Feel free to contact me for help. Also note that our last class on April 19 
will be just for you to ask questions about your project and to get help.
