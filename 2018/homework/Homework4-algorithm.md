# Homework 4

## Due March 13, 5pm

Following on our class discussion of laws as algorithms, for this assignment 
please create a javascript function that expresses the substance of [La. Civil 
Code Article 103](http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=108533). Your 
function should return true if the person is entitled to a divorce and false if 
not. Note that this assignment is actually simpler than the ones we did in 
class; extra credit will be awarded for those who are able to complete the 
assignment in the fewest lines of code.
