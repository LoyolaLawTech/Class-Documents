# Algorithm-Based App

## Due April 2 at 5pm 

We've seen in the last couple of classes how laws can sometimes be expressed 
algorithms. For our next assignment (which is more of a mini-project), I would 
like you to create a small app built around a law algorithm.  Your app 
(completed in a JSBin) should have:

1. An algorithm expressed as a javascript function. The function should have at 
   least three arguments. (For comparison, our [graduation 
   app](http://jsbin.com/xodujut/3/edit?html,js,output) only had two).  This 
   can be any Louisiana or federal law.  As an alternative to using a law, you 
   might similarly create a client-screening application which determines a 
   client's suitability to bring a certain type of case or receive a certain 
   benefit. 

2. A user interface which asks the relevant questions to the user and provides 
   the user an answer. Extra credit will be awarded for those that use 
   [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) to make a more attractive UI. The UI 
   should make it clear to the user what your app does.

3. jQuery to get the values from the user, pass them to the function, and 
   return the answer (as we did in our graduation app).

You have two weeks to complete this project, so take your time and do your best 
work.  Feel free to contact me with questions.
