# jQuery Continued

For homework, I would like you to do this simple task. Create a form in JSBin 
with two text inputs named City and State and a button to submit the form. You 
do not have to use Bootstrap to style these forms, but you will get extra 
credit if you do.  Then create an empty paragraph using a "p" tag.  Design your 
form such that when a user clicks on the submit button, jQuery gets the data 
the user has entered using the val() method and puts that data inside your 
empty paragraph using the text() method. Simple, right?

Remember to consult the API for help:

http://api.jquery.com/text/

This homework is due on Tuesday, 3/29 at 8am.
