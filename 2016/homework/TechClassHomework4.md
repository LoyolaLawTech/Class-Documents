# Beginning Javascript

I would like you to apply what we learned in class today to the following 
problems.  All work should be done in a JSBin which returns no errors when the 
Javascript is run.

1.  Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the 
    largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.

2.  Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies 
    (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, 
    sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24

3.  Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and 
    returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
