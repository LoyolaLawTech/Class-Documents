# Homework 6: A Simple List App

I would like you to make a program using HTML and jQuery that works like the 
one in [this 
video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7JWfzOhqNgNMFJPQ01EbzBJTlE/view?usp=sharing).  
Look at at what it does: when the "Add to List" button is pressed, it takes the 
user input and adds it to a list. It then clears the input, freeing up the user 
to enter another item.  When the user clicks the "Reset List" link, the list is 
cleared.  You can create this using the jQuery methods we have covered in 
class.

Hints:
* Obviously, the list is a ul with several li tags inside
* These jQuery methods will come in handy: click(), append(), remove(), val()

Do this in a new jsBin and send me the link to what you have done. This 
assignment is due Monday, April 4 by 5pm.

## Extra Credit:
If you feel so inclined, try to add some additional functionality to this 
application. Some suggestions: 

1. Design it so that the input value is added to the list when the user presses Enter,
rather than having to press the button 
2. Add an option to delete an individual list item, rather than the whole list.
