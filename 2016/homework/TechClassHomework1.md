# Homework 1 - Beginning HTML

## Due January 27, 10am

Our first assignment is a simple and  gentle introduction to HTML. After our 
brief discussion in class, you should have a general idea about what HTML is 
and Markup languages are. Begin by creating a new bin on [JSBin](http://jsbin.com).
You will see that, by default, JSBin gives you a basic HTML template to work 
with.  Study each of the tags you see there and make sure you understand what 
they do. There are millions or resources on the web for you if you have 
questions or are having difficulty understanding. (You might try [this simple 
guide](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/) for starters.)

Once you have done that, I would like for you to create a simple resume for 
yourself in HTML. The resume should include the following information in the 
following tags:

1. Your name, address, email address - these should use h1 and h2 tags.  This 
   information should be at the top of the page. Your email address should be a 
   clickable link using an anchor tag.

Hint: For the clickable email tag, look into "mailto:". 

````
<a href="mailto:"></a>

````

2. An unordered list which tells me the schools you attended and any jobs you 
   have had (this doesn't need to be exhaustive, just give me the highlights).

Hint:

````
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

````

3. A paragraph which describes your career objectives and which employs the 
   following tags for styling: p, strong, em.

4. An image (from a publicly-available URL) that either shows your face  or 
   demonstrates your career aspirations in some way.

Hint:

````
<img src="URL OF YOUR IMAGE" />

````

Once you have done this, please email me the link to your bin so that I can 
check it and give you a grade.
