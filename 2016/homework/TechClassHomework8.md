# Homework 8 - The Final Assignment

This is the final assignment for Tech Clinic. In it, we will try to review over 
the things we have done this semester and hopefully synthesize them to create a 
simple app.

This homework is worth double the usual number of points (20 instead of 10), so 
it will give you a chance to make up for any points you may have missed 
throughout the semester. There is a further 10 points of extra credit for 
assignments that show extra effort.

The homework is due Tuesday, May 3 by 5pm.

The assignment is to create a page that takes a search term provided by the 
user, queries an API of your choice for data, and returns the results to the 
user in a nicely formatted way.

Your completed app **must** contain:

* An input to receive the search term and a button to initiate the request
* An AJAX call using jQuery to an API which queries the API for data related to 
the search term
* An area to display the search results in well-formatted HTML.

If you do this well, you will demonstrate that you have a basic  understanding 
of 1) HTML layout, 2) javascript events, 3) AJAX requests, 4) working with JSON, and 5) templating or text substitution.

For extra credit, your app **can** contain:

* Well formatted HTML done with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* A navigation bar with a link to another page (e.g, "About this App").
* Extra features, such as the ability to limit the data displayed by some other 
query data (date range, for example).
* Imaginative use of javascript to, for example, show or hide some elements.
* Some other creative feature that makes your app more interesting.

## Some suggested APIs

* NFL Arrest - http://nflarrest.com/api/ (Suggestion: an app that searches the 
arrests by player name)
* Court Listener - https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/ (Suggestion: An 
app that searches for legal terms in a case in a given jurisdiction)
* State Decoded - http://statedecoded.github.io/documentation/api.html#method-search
(Suggestion: search the Virgina state code for user-provided search terms
* Old Bailey -http://criminalintent.org/for-developers/ (Suggestion: search 
historical records of London's Old Bailey court)

More legal APIs are available in the [Programmable Web 
Index](http://www.programmableweb.com/category/law/apis?category=20269&data_format=21173).
