# Layout and Bootstrap

## Exercise One

Let's layout a webpage like it's 1999! In JSBin, create a page for me that has 
three columns. Each column should have some Lorem Ipsum in it, and one of the 
columns should have an image. You will make the columns by creating a table 
that is 1200px in width

## Exercise Two

Open up a JSBin, add Bootstrap. Create the same three column layout, with the 
same content, using the responsive design classes provided by Bootstrap.
