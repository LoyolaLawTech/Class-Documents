# jQuery 3- Some Review and Some New Methods

To practice a bit more, please do the following in jQuery: 

* In, JSBin, create a string which contains some Lorem Ipsem text. Create an 
empty paragraph. Add a button which, when clicked, puts the text from your 
string in the paragraph and makes the text bold. (Hint: the boldness can be 
added either by CSS in your markup, or by javascript).

* Create an unordered list (html tag: ul). Create an anchor tag that when 
clicked adds items to the unordered list. Use jQuery's *append* method.

* Create another anchor tag that, when clicked, removes the last list item. Use 
jQuery's *last()* and *remove()* methods

* Create a form with one text input called "username". Using jQuery, check that 
the user has not submitted and empty form field and give them a warning that 
username is required if they do. Use jQuery's *val()* method to get the user's 
input.

* Now change your form. Pretend your user is submitting a new username. You 
have a rule that all username's must be at least 5 characters long. Give the 
user a warning if they submit a username less than 5 characters. To check if 
the user has supplied enough characters, use javascript's built in length 
method.
