# CSS

# Exercise One

Create an HTML table with at least four columns and three rows. Make sure that 
your table has a header.  

With CSS, make the following changes to your table's appearance:

 * All fonts are arial, sans
 * The table itself has a black border all around, 1px in width
 * The table header has a light grey background
 * The even rows of your table have the class "even" which gives those rows a 
 yellow background
 * One of your table header cells has an ID of "special" which makes its text 
 green


# Exercise Two

Create a form with the fields "Username", "Password", and "Email", and two 
buttons, "Submit" and "Cancel". Your form should have the following 
characteristics:

* The text in the boxes should be 20pt, with a sans serif font
* The password field should not reveal the user's password as they type
* The fields username and password should have a class attached to them that 
shows the user they are required.
* Your inputs should have labels in which the text is light gray
* The Submit and Cancel buttons should have different colored text

Your style rules should have at least one class and one ID.
