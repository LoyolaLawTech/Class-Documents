# Class Exercise - Manipulating DOM

## Pop Quiz

Create a function that has three arguments: the first two are numbers and the 
third one tells the function to add or subtract the numbers.

## Using Jquery

Let's review some HTML. Create an HTML document that has the following 
characteristics and uses CSS classes:

* Three divs which are 100px in width and length
* Each div has one of the following background colors: red, blue, and green.
* The name of the color as the text inside the div

Now, add Jquery to your document and make the following things happen:

* When the user clicks on the blue box, an alert pops up and says "Blue";
* When the user clicks on the red box, the background color changes to purple
* When the user clicks on the green box, the background color changes to brown 
and the text in the box changes to "now brown"

Now, add one button to your page which fades out all of the boxes and another 
that fades in all of the boxes.
