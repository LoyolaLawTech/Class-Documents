# Homework 8 - Javascript Objects

## Due before the last day of class

For this assignment, please create a file named remote-class-hm2.js in your 
public_html directory. In this file, create a javascript object called myCube.
The object should have the following properties: length, height, and width.  
Give these properties whatever values you want, as long as they are all numbers 
(not strings!). The myCube object should also have a fourth property called 
"volume" which is a function that calculates the volume of the cube. (If you 
don't remember from school, volume is length x width x height).

Also in your js file, call the "volume" function and have the volume of the 
cube display (via console.log) to the console.

Good luck!
