# Functions

## Homework Due Wednesday, February 26 at noon.

For this assignment, you should create a javascript function that is a simple 
calculator. The function should take three arguments (i.e., inputs):

* num1 - a number
* num2 - another number
* operator - +,-,*,/ (the math operation to be performed)

For help with this, view the source of the page we did in class:
http://dev.loyolalawtech.org/~jmitchell/js.html

Some hints:

* All of your logic should be contained inside your function
* Inside your function, you will likely have four "if" statements
* The only code that should be outside of your function is the statement which 
calls it, e.g,:

```js
    console.log(calc(1,2,'*');
```

Good luck!
