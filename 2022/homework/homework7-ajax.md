# Homework 7 - AJAX

## Due March 30 at 5pm

Here is a fairly simple homework assignment about AJAX requests. Create two 
files in your public_html directory: ajaxhm.html and ajaxhm.js.  In the HTML 
file, create an empty DIV with an ID and a button below it that says "Show 
Random Word".  In your JS file, make an AJAX request to the [Random Word 
Generator](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and insert the word it 
gives you in your DIV.  The URL for the AJAX request is:

```html

https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=1

```

A video example of how this would function [can be found
